Welcome to the Pokemon database/repository!

This image repository is designed to hold the image, name, pokedex number, and typings of various Pokemon. It is written in Java, and can be run through the Repository.java file.

This program implements a JPanel for outputting the images, its various data, and for clicking through the Pokemon list. The rest of the user commands are completed through System.out. once the user reaches the end of the list.

I have programmed 4 different functions: adding a new Pokemon to the list, reordering the displayed list, applying or removing a filter from the list, and exiting the program while saving any additions.

The repository is saved in a data index holding the data for each Pokemon, and 2 order indexes that hold numerical and alphabetical orders of outputting the Pokemon list.

A note on the ImageShape class: this is not my work, I borrowed the code from an old high school course (with the instructor's permission).

I had also planned to add an ordering by typing, as well as location data for each Pokemon that could be filtered or ordered by. However, I ran out of time due to the new school semester. Similarly, I realized that the user could input a nonexistent image into the list.

I hope you enjoy the repository! I had a lot of fun programming it and overcoming the more interesting issues.
